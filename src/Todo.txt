BUGS:


GENERAL TO DO:
-Handle pawn conversion to other piece at rank 8
    -Manually add to pawn getMove function

--> Make it so that the AI does not care about check
-Add in thing that says whose turn it is
-Add in option for different color themes
-Add in information button (to display information)
-Resolve bug where it waits for the computer to move to update the icon for the players move
-Handle null pointer exception when no game state has yet been selected
-Add in stalemate
-Fix bug that terminates move search when break is discovered
    -Add boolean checktesting

If time permits:
-Add En Passant
